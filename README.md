# Wind-Turbine-Ocean_Impacts
Meta-repository for code used in analyses of offshore wind turbines on ocean dynamics for the paper "Sea Surface Temperature Impacts in the Presence of Wind Stress Perturbations"

This meta-repository contains notebooks that will reproduce the analyses and figures for the paper, "Sea Surface Temperature Impacts in the Presence of Wind Stress Perturbations" by Kyle Hinson, Brian Gaudet, Tianyi Li, Robert Hetland, Jeffrey Mirocha, Zhaoqing Yang, and Raghavendra Krishnamurthy, submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans.

Multiple jupyter notebooks may be found in the Notebooks directory, corresponding to the manuscript figures and based on output files in the Zenodo archive (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17527225). Input parameters and header files for ROMS and COAWST simulations are specified in the Code directory.
